For this research task I have decided to source a game of Tic Tac Toe. This code takes the iconic game that we all know and love and enables users to play the game with the touch of a key board, adding a new school twist! the code I have sourced codes for eveything from the famillar grid like board down to all the combinations of moves that it takes to win. 

what is a fixed mind set?
Those who hold a fixed mindset believe that their ability to carry out an activity is based on their innate nature, or based on talent you could say. People with this mind set believe that traits are fixed, either they're good or bad at carrying out a task. they also believe that these traits and skills cannot be improved. An example of a fixed mindset is someone stating "I'm bad at coding", someone who holds a mindset such as this will believe the statement to be ture and will avoid challenges that offer room for improvement. They will often ignore feedback, taking it as criticism. 
I believe this mindset to be debilitating because we live in an ever changing world that is always evloving, and believing that we as humans are unable to improve and grow is something that can lead a person to feel stuck, and to lessen their self worth. 
I think that with this ever changing world it is upto us to adapt and grow alongside it, especially being apart of the tech industry. Technology is taking off and becoming the forefront in bussiness and all throught out our lives in general. With new advancements in areas such as AI, Networking and Coding languages, it is upto us learn about these advancements and to improve and upskill our knowledge to stay relevant. 
The reason I think that having a fixed mindset debilitating is because growth and change is apart of human nature, so staying fixed and ridged within our thinking can be damaging to our mental health. Our mindsets affect our motivation and resliance. so i think that having a fixed mindset and believing you can't do something will slow you down affecting your achievment and success within certain areas of life. 
A fixed mindset is just one end of the spectrum, the opposite of this is a growth mindset which is the mind set more of us need to have. changing our thinking from "I am bad at coding" to "I can improve my coding skills with effort and practice".
