For this research task I have decided to source a game of Tic Tac Toe. This code takes the iconic game that we all know and love and enables users to play the game with the touch of a key board, adding a new school twist! the code I have sourced codes for eveything from the famillar grid like board down to all the combinations of moves that it takes to win. 


what is a fixed mind set?

Those who hold a fixed mindset believe that their ability to carry out an activity is based on their innate nature, or based on talent you could say. People with this mind set believe that traits are fixed, either they're good or bad at carrying out a task. they also believe that these traits and skills cannot be improved. An example of a fixed mindset is someone stating "I'm bad at coding", someone who holds a mindset such as this will believe the statement to be ture and will avoid challenges that offer room for improvement. They will often ignore feedback, taking it as criticism. 

I believe this mindset to be debilitating because we live in an ever changing world that is always evloving, and believing that we as humans are unable to improve and grow is something that can lead a person to feel stuck, and to lessen their self worth. I think that with this ever changing world it is upto us to adapt and grow alongside it, especially being apart of the tech industry. Technology is taking off and becoming the forefront in bussiness and all throught out our lives in general. With new advancements in areas such as AI, Networking and Coding languages, it is upto us learn about these advancements and to improve and upskill our knowledge to stay relevant. 

The reason I think that having a fixed mindset debilitating is because growth and change is apart of human nature, so staying fixed and ridged within our thinking can be damaging to our mental health. Our mindsets affect our motivation and resliance. so i think that having a fixed mindset and believing you can't do something will slow you down affecting your achievment and success within certain areas of life. 

A fixed mindset is just one end of the spectrum, the opposite of this is a growth mindset which is the mind set more of us need to have. changing our thinking from "I am bad at coding" to "I can improve my coding skills with effort and practice".



What is an IDE?

IDE is an abbreviation for an Intergrated Development Environment and is an application that makes coding easier and more efficient. IDE as stated in the name intergrates many tools needed within coding, such as editing code, built in complier engines and debugging tools. 

Before IDE developers would have to run these tools indvidualy. running each tool was very time consuming and inefficient as each tool was solitary component that ran in an isolated environment thus creating a disjointed workflow, But when Maestro I the first IDE was launched by Softlab Munich in the 1980's many developers world wide jumped on board with this intergration system. It wasn't until Microsoft launched their own IDE with Visual Basic (VB) in 1991 that IDEs became mainstream paving the way for modern IDE software and applications. 

An IDE poses many benefits with intergrating its many tools within one application. one of the key tools is the code editor. simillar to a text editor a code editor allows the developer to write thier code, but specialised fucnctions are able to make it more efficent such as predicting and autocompleting a command making time management more efficient. IDEs also provide syntax highlighting, this provides visual cues for keywords. This is very benefical as it makes interprating code easier for the human developer and provides overall legibility.  

IDE's provide complining engines. a complier converts programming languages that humans are able to understand into machine readable languages such as binary, this poses great benfit as it allows developers to run and test thier code in the same environment they're writing said code in. 

Debugging tools make coding very efficient as a developer is able to run thier code and debugging tools are able to inform them on errors such as missing variables or incorrect commands and even incorrect indenting. debugging tools flag these bugs and direct the coder straight to the problem rather than them having to observe the errors as done before IDE's. 

IDE is a great tool when it comes to creating code and is seen throughout many applications in this mordern world, we can see an example of it within github with to syntax highlighting of my code. But over all IDEs are very beneficial for developer when creating code and allows for better time management as they're able create, run and debug their code within one environment creating smooth workflows that are less suscepitable to disorganisation. The tools talked about are only some of the tools that an IDE provides. 



what is OOP?

Object-oriendted programming is a programming paradigm (programming style) centered around objects in which data sets are represented via real world objects. This programming style very reliable when doing collbrative projects due to organisaiton of object orientated applications and code resuability makes this paradigm very efficient. Naming objects with real world names allows a developer to create a system that interactes with real life items, such as an end user. an example of this would be a ticket system that I have created in the past, where end users would use it to gather inforamtion about staff problems and then be able to solve them. 

OOP relies on many to components to work but one of the main components is creating a class. Classes are the blue print to creating an object as they contain user defined descriptions that define the object such as attributes or variables and methods that allows the object to funciton. 

another key comoponet is Syntax which refers to a set of principles that defines how a language is structed. syntax utalises specific symbols, words and punctuation to carry out specific fuctions. without the use of syntax a complier wont be able to understand or interperet the meaning of the language if these principles aren't kept to. the code I have sourced makes use of the coding language python and adheres to using specific words such as "if" and "elif" statements as well as using specific symbols to such as "=" and correct punctuation that create functions that a computer is able to run and carry out due to legeibily as makes use of these prinicples. 

another component revelent to OOP is encapsulation. this process involves grouping data and functions into a single unit. This is benefical as it restricts users from accessing certain conponents of an object such as state values within an object. but these are only some of the components that make up OOP.



What is python?

python is programming language, and has become very popular due to its versatility. python was released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. Python is an general purpose language and is used to create many projects from building websites and software, task automation, data analysis and can even be used for software prototyping and testing. Python was used for readabibility which is why it has many similarities to the english language. Python unlike other languages that use parentheses or semicolons to end command python utilize new lines to end it commands. Python also relies on the use of white space and indentations to define classes, loops and functions. Many developers use phython not only for its but also for its efficieny as python offers many great features such as its interperter system allowing code to be run and tested as soon as it is written, it also allows developers to write their code with fewer lines.   

the game code I have sourced was created using the python language.
